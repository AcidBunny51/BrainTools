## BrainTools Commands :-
- ```gc``` -> To compile files that in the same directory only
- ```gcmf``` -> To compile files that in the same directory and the files that is in directorys inside of the path directory
- ```pm``` -> To create CPP project and it will make **Hello, World!** code automaticly in it | It includes `[Project name that you selected it in the cmd] > main.cpp`

## Lastly :-
- I will try to fix the problems in it like to add librarys/includes
- Try to make it useable in other terminals
- And make it multi-platform use

And that's it :)
